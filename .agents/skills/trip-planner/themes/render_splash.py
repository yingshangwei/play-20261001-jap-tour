"""Splash-theme renderer — one Brawl-Stars-style splash poster stretched
into a vertical scroll.

Identity (the four axes, distinct from the other six themes):
  * organising principle: a single poster's light-field extended downward as
    a chained per-chapter gradient (stop N end == stop N+1 start) that now
    tells a full day/night colour story (night flight → NYC neon → lilac
    day → stadium night → dusk west → rainbow springs → alpine morning →
    golden fog → canyon teal → pacific blue → lava → sunrise gold → night),
    plus diagonal palette washes + light streaks + soft-focus blobs + a
    seeded heart/triangle/spark particle field (build-time PRNG, never JS
    random) + a wide-viewport side field of same-brush splash clouds /
    rainbow balloon / four-point star / sparks / glow dots parked outside
    the text column, and silhouette strips (a trip's own skyline / sunset
    cut-outs, e.g. a night city under the first two chapters) melted into
    the chapter foot as the farthest scenery layer — opacity-capped and
    budgeted by contrast_report(), parked behind the hill silhouettes;
  * interaction: plain vertical scroll along one glowing ribbon road — an
    SVG gradient-stroked path drawn PER CHAPTER (a page-long path would be
    rasterised at full length; see theme-system §4.4) that parks in the
    3.5% / 96.5% gutters so its bright core mathematically never crosses
    the text bands at any viewport width; chapter seams are bridged by
    hill silhouettes whose two halves are each drawn by their own chapter;
  * type voice: the painted title plate (art: hero.title) + heavy rounded
    system faces (weight 800/900, tracked), brush-feel giant numerals 01-11;
  * shape language: big cut-out silhouettes and confetti shards; rainbow
    arches / sun discs / halos / radial beams behind the floating islands
    (all CSS gradients — zero extra image cost); buttons are skewed solid
    slabs; a trip's painted vehicles (a prop plane with cream speed lines
    on its flight days, a luggage-rack tour bus on its group-tour days…)
    and mascot stickers ride the chapter heads — all inside .scene so they
    can never reach band copy; NO white rounded cards anywhere — body copy
    sits on feather-edged darker patches of the same light-field.

ART CONTRACT (what this renderer reads from the trip's art.json — schema in
ART-SCHEMA.md — and how it degrades when a field is missing; the renderer
never carries a place, a date or a picture name of its own):

  common (themes.splash.cover.* / .end.* override cover.* / end.* per key)
    cover.zh          alt text of the painted title plate, and the TEXT title
                      when the trip has no plate → cover.kick → 「出发!」
    cover.sub         the route line under the poster ("纽约 · 球赛 · 黄石")
                      → the plan's meta.route → line omitted
    cover.en          small-caps English line right under the title plate
                      (.en, cream, tracked) → not written
    cover.credit      allusion / source line under the route: one cream
                      monospace badge (.credit) → not written. Keep the poem
                      citation HERE, not in `sub` (that is what two-lined the
                      China cover: an English sub carrying route + citation).
    brief_titles      (art common) {brief key: display title} overlay on
                      theme_common.BRIEF_TITLES — the 行前须知 card headings
                      ("visa" → 签证 · EVUS); unknown keys print as they are
    cover.kick        <title> prefix ("{kick} {year} · 闪屏版行程") and the
                      export filename prefix (theme_common.export_prefix);
                      en page: cover.kick_en wins when set (title_kick)
                      → "{year} · 闪屏版行程" / "{year}-"
    end.line / .fine  endcap closing line / fine print → not written (the
                      spark glyph stays)
    days[d].theme     4-char day title (h2 + jump aria-label) → plan city
  themes.splash
    hero.title        asset stem of the painted title plate (md variant)
                      → cover.zh as an outlined text title
    hero.art          asset stem of the poster's floating hero island (md)
                      → the figure is dropped (its fx go with it)
    hero.palette / hero.scene / hero.wash   colour of the first chapter (see
                      PALETTE below) → kit mood "night"
    hero.sides        extra side-field kinds for the hero, e.g. ["balloon"]
                      → the seeded kit pool only
    appendix.palette / .scene / .wash / .sides   same for the last chapter
                      → kit mood "homebound"; sides pool only
    vehicles          {name: {stem, ratio, speedlines?}} the trip's painted
                      vehicles (class .veh-<name>; ratio = "w/h" of the
                      cut-out; speedlines adds the cream trails behind a
                      plane). A vehicle whose asset is not found paints
                      nothing wherever it is placed.
    mascots           {name: {stem, ratio}} sticker mascots (.mas-<name>)
    strips            {name: {stem, ratio}} foot silhouettes (.strip-<name>),
                      centred, opacity-capped at STRIP_A
    days[d].palette   kit mood name for the chapter's sky (chained: the
                      chapter starts on the previous chapter's last stop)
    days[d].scene     OR explicit gradient stops ["#hex", …] (verbatim — the
                      author owns the seam) · days[d].wash = wash/streak
                      pastels; missing → DEFAULT_RHYTHM cycles the moods
    days[d].island    asset stem of the day's floating island (sm variant)
                      → none (a CSS medallion takes the slot unless fx says
                      otherwise)
    days[d].fx        scene effect behind the island, one of the kit
                      (halo-cyan · halo-gold · halo-teal · burst · beams-cool
                      · rainbow · "rainbow sm" · sun · moon · dusk · sunrise;
                      "" = nothing) → "" with an island, else a medallion
                      by day-number rhythm (moon / dusk / sunrise)
    days[d].vehicle   {kind, when: pre|post, pos} — kind names a `vehicles`
                      entry, when = behind/in front of the island, pos =
                      inline CSS placement inside .scene → none
    days[d].mascot    {kind, pos} — kind names a `mascots` entry → none
    days[d].strip     name of a `strips` entry → none
    days[d].sides     extra side-field kinds (kit words cloud · spark · dot
                      · shard · heart · star · balloon, or {"stem", "w"} for
                      one of the trip's own cut-outs) → pool only

  PALETTE (kit): MOODS names the theme's twelve sky moods — each is four
  gradient stops + its wash pastels, every stop pre-verified dark enough for
  AA under the band (contrast_report() re-checks the resolved chain at build
  time). Chapters chain: stop 0 of chapter N+1 == stop 3 of chapter N, so
  any mood order still seams cleanly.

  ASSET SIZE VARIANTS (hero.sides / appendix.sides trip cut-outs {"stem","w"} → sm) (theme_common.data_uri; the wrong guess is silent):
    hero.title / hero.art → "md" (<stem>.md.webp, falls back to .cut / plain)
    days[d].island        → "sm"
    vehicles / mascots / strips (registry stems) → "cut" (the cut-out itself)
    kit cut-outs (splash-cloud-* / -star / -balloon) → "cut"
    `ratio` in a registry entry is the CUT-OUT's w/h, not the sheet's.

  TEXT LIMITS (measured 2026-08-15 in headless Chrome at a 1200px viewport
  → 1152px of hero text, and at 390px → 342px; the plate-less text title
  .ht-txt is var(--disp) 900 at clamp(52px,12vw,124px), .06em). One line
  holds at most:
    title (no plate)  ~14 Latin caps / 8 CJK           (1200px, 124px type;
                      re-measured with line-box counts — the .ht pop
                      animation scales to .72 at t=0, which once inflated
                      an earlier estimate to 21/12)
                      ~8 Latin caps / 5 CJK           (390px, 52px type, est.)
                      — "MOON OF QIN" (11) needs a plate on a phone; a painted
                      plate (md, 600px wide) has no text limit, its words
                      are pixels.
    sub / .route      63 Latin / 45 CJK (1200px) · 27 Latin / 18 CJK (390px)
                      — 78-char English subs two-line the phone cover; put
                      the citation in `credit` instead.
    en                92 Latin (1200px) · 34 Latin (390px)  (12px caps)
    credit            79 Latin / 46 CJK (1200px) · 43 Latin / 25 CJK (390px)
                      inside the badge (12px mono; wraps, badge stays ≤600px)
  Everything wraps rather than overflows; only the title's wrap looks wrong.

  KIT (nothing to pick in art): the ribbon road + gutters, hills, seeded
  confetti / washes / blobs, the side-field pool and its cloud / star /
  balloon cut-outs (theme library), rainbow / halo / sun / burst / beam fx,
  the three CSS medallions, big numerals, bands, export badges.

PNG export (share): theme_common.export_js engine, whole page + per-chapter
modules. Wording is the family-wide one — 「保存这一天」/「保存附录」 per
module, 「生成长图」 for the whole scroll. The badges speak the theme's own
shape language — skewed solid slabs, kin of the mapfold/hop chips and of
.tag-pin's hard purple drop, with a painted #3A1272 stroke and a pink halo
so they are legible at rest at an UNCHANGED 12.5px (one per day chapter,
one on the appendix, one fixed whole-page badge). The per-module badges ride
in normal flow at the foot of their own band — the earlier absolute
bottom-right parking put them straight across the glowing ribbon road, which
lives in the 96.5% gutter. extra_css pins .reveal visible and
zeroes the hero's 100svh (vh resolves against the FULL capture height inside
the SVG image document, which would balloon the hero in a whole-page grab).
Icons and confetti particles are <use> references to the page-top sprite;
capture clones are serialised as standalone documents, so the export engine
(theme_common.export_js → spriteFor) copies the referenced <symbol>s into
every capture — this renderer does nothing extra for it. (Until 2026-08-15
nothing did, and every icon/particle exported blank; the other themes had
dodged it by inlining icons at build time.)

Usage: python3 render_splash.py <plan.geo.json> [--art <art.json>|none]
                                [--assets DIR ...] -o <out.html>
Assets (islands, vehicles, mascots, strips) are searched in the plan's
directory, every --assets DIR, then themes/assets/ (theme_common.data_uri).
