"""Day-route toolbox for the trip-planner skill (stdlib only, Python 3.9+).

Input: a plan JSON — the SAME file render_plan.py consumes, so the map links, the
KML and the written plan can never drift apart:
{
  "trip": "kyoto-oct",
  "tz": "Asia/Tokyo",                      # optional, IANA name; days may override
  "days": [
    {"date": "2026-10-05", "label": "East Kyoto", "tz": "Asia/Tokyo",
     "stops": [
       {"name": "清水寺", "query": "Kiyomizu-dera, Kyoto, Japan"},
       {"name": "Nishiki Market", "lat": 35.005, "lon": 135.764, "mode": "transit"}
     ]}
  ]
}
"query" defaults to "name"; a stop with lat/lon pre-filled skips geocoding; a day
with no stops (a travel day) is fine.

Optional stop "mode" describes the hop INTO that stop and overrides the distance
guess. Values: "walk" | "transit" | "fly" | "drive" | "boat" | "train" | "bus".
Set it whenever the traveller rides a short hop or walks a long one, because it
decides both the walking total and which directions the tappable link opens. Model
a long stroll as a stop at its midpoint, otherwise its kilometres never reach the
walking total. A hop with NO mode is GUESSED from straight-line distance
(<=1.6 km walk, else transit); `check` reports guessed and declared totals apart
and only a hop that is both undeclared AND >12 km counts as SUSPICIOUS (exit 2) —
a declared fly/drive/boat/train/bus hop of any length is a normal itinerary shape,
never a failure.

Timeline hop rows and map links (links --write): hop rows (kind:"hop", map != false)
correspond 1:1, IN ORDER, with the stop-to-stop hops of that day. Two shapes break
that silently and MUST be handled in the plan: the FIRST hop of a day (lodging ->
first stop) and the LAST hop (-> lodging) either carry "map": false, or the lodging
itself is written into stops[0] / stops[-1].
Rail / flight / boat rows — the ONE rule ("map": false depends on the stops list,
not on the vehicle):
  * both ends ARE in that day's stops[] (e.g. stops: [..., 西安北站, 北京西站, ...])
    -> leave the row mappable (NO "map": false). It is one of the day's hops, so it
       keeps the count aligned; `links --write` writes NO link onto it (long leg,
       kept for alignment) and says so.
  * the leg is covered only by legs[] and its stations are NOT in stops[]
    (e.g. stops jump from a Rome museum straight to a Florence piazza)
    -> mark the row "map": false, so it sits outside the stop-to-stop pairing.
  Getting this wrong is silent-ish: N rows vs N+1 hops -> the whole day is parked in
  day["hop_links"] (a WARN tells you), or every later pairing shifts by one.
`links --write` prints the origin -> destination place names next to the row text
it wrote to, refuses a row that names a different stop of the day (weak name check;
the URL is parked in day["hop_links"] instead), and never emits a transit deep link
for a hop >100 km or a declared fly/boat hop (those are covered by legs[]/the
operator's link) — such rows are counted as "long legs kept unlinked (expected)".
The name check (Mexico F2, Turkey F3): only the text around the arrow counts; a
match is case/accent-insensitive and, for Latin words, whole-word ("Mural" does not
hit "Muralismo"); LONGEST FIRST — another stop's name that is a substring of one of
this hop's endpoint names ("格雷梅" inside "格雷梅露天博物馆", "centro" inside
"Hotel · Oaxaca centro") is not a hit, but a longer other-stop name that CONTAINS
the endpoint's name is; a token shared by two differently-named stops of the day
("centro", "Museo") is generic and never a hit on its own. Parking is the designed
fallback and keeps exit 0, but whenever parked > 0 the run ends with a loud stderr
WARN block listing every parked row (day, row number, first 40 chars) — read it.

Map provider (links --provider google|apple|amap, default google):
  google  https://www.google.com/maps/dir/?api=1&origin=..&destination=..&travelmode=..
  apple   https://maps.apple.com/?saddr=lat,lon&daddr=lat,lon&dirflg=w|r|d
  amap    https://uri.amap.com/navigation?from=lon,lat,name&to=lon,lat,name
          &mode=walk|bus|car&src=trip-planner   (keyless; 高德, works in mainland CN)
When the provider is google and a link is actually printed/written whose endpoint
lies in mainland China (coarse polygon, HK/MO/TW excluded), one WARN reminds you
that Google Maps is unreachable behind the GFW and suggests --provider amap or
apple. A Chinese stop by itself (the usual departure airport, its rows map:false)
does not warn (Turkey F8). Whole-day DAY CHAIN links (multi-point) exist for google
and apple only; amap gets per-hop links and no day_map.

Name the file plan.geo.json from the start: geocode then edits it in place and every
later command reads the one file that has everything.

Subcommands:
  geocode plan.geo.json       -> resolves stops in place (+ geocache.json), via
                                 Nominatim/OSM; existing coordinates are PRESERVED
  check   plan.geo.json       -> hop distances (straight-line), walk/transit
                                 estimates marked (est), on-foot vs ridden totals
                                 split into declared / guessed; warns (stderr) when a
                                 day has 0 km on foot but >=2 anchor rows; exits 2
                                 only on an undeclared suspicious hop or a hop with
                                 missing coordinates
  links   plan.geo.json [--write] [--provider google|apple|amap]
                              -> per-hop map links + whole-day chain links;
                                 --write injects them into the plan's hop rows and
                                 ends with a "wrote / parked / suspicious" summary
  kml     plan.geo.json -o trip.kml  -> numbered pins + day route lines
                                        (import into Organic Maps / Google My Maps)
  sun     plan.geo.json [--write] [--tz auto|Area/City] [--only DATE,...] [--lang zh|en]
                              -> per-day civil dawn / sunrise / sunset from
                                 api.sunrise-sunset.org (city-level: the day's first
                                 stop with coordinates; on a MOVING day — travel_day
                                 true, or first and last stop >150 km apart — the LAST
                                 stop with coordinates, because that is where the
                                 evening is spent; day["sun_stop"] = a stop's name or
                                 0-based index in stops[] overrides that pick — e.g.
                                 a "sunrise in Chefchaouen, then fly to Casablanca"
                                 day whose timeline hangs on the FIRST city — the
                                 pick reason then prints "sun_stop=…"; unknown or
                                 coordinate-less -> WARN + old rule), cross-checked
                                 against a local solar model before anything is
                                 written; --write sets day["sun"] to the canonical string
                                 "天亮 HH:MM · ☀ HH:MM / 🌇 HH:MM · TZ · sunrise-sunset.org"
                                 (--lang en, or plan.lang / plan.meta.lang == "en":
                                 "dawn HH:MM · ☀ HH:MM / 🌇 HH:MM · TZ · sunrise-sunset.org")
                                 (renderers take the first HH:MM after 🌇 — keep a
                                 space after every time). Cached in suncache.json next
                                 to the plan, so re-runs on the same day are free.

Time zone for `sun`: day["tz"] > --tz Area/City > plan["tz"] / plan["meta"]["tz"] >
longitude-derived UTC offset (approximate, no DST — printed but NEVER written; pass
--tz or set tz in the plan to write those days).

Sanity checks in `sun` (why they exist: a broken request once returned "equator,
today" with status OK and nearly shipped as Norwegian October data): status must be
OK; the returned local date must equal the requested date; sunrise/sunset must agree
with the local NOAA solar model within 12 min; day length must match within 20 min;
two different days must not come back byte-identical. Any failure -> that day is
reported on stderr and NOT written, and the command exits 3. Every day that ends up
NOT written (no ISO date, no coordinates, approximate tz, request failed, rejected)
gets its own WARN line on stderr and the closing summary lists them by date — do not
count the written days yourself (a day with no stops at all is informational, not
counted). Exit codes of `sun`: 0 = every day handled; 1 = at
least one day NOT written (the others ARE written — re-run `sun --write --only
DATE[,DATE]` for the listed dates; a request/TLS failure just needs the retry, a
missing date / coordinates / approximate tz needs the plan fixed); 3 = a day was
REJECTED by the sanity checks (look before retrying). Non-zero always means "some
day has no sun value from this run" — the file may still have been updated.

Nominatim usage policy is enforced here (User-Agent, 1 req/s, cache) — do not
parallelize around this script and do not strip the throttle. sunrise-sunset.org is
called with the same User-Agent (urllib without one gets 403). geocode also warns
when a hit's display_name does not contain the query's head token (first Latin word
of >=4 letters, or the first 2 CJK characters) — Nominatim happily returns a
guesthouse named after the street, or a bus stop 600 m from the station; that WARN
means "open the coordinates and look before trusting them".

Change log (2026-08-15, after the AU / Nordic test runs):
- links --write: per-link origin -> destination names printed against the row text;
  weak stop-name mismatch check; no transit link >100 km or for fly/boat; summary.
- check: declared vs guessed totals; 0-km-on-foot warning; new long-hop modes do not
  trip exit 2; transit >20 km prints "use the operator timetable" instead of a 4-10x
  overestimated range; (est) markers; warnings on stderr.
- new `sun` subcommand with cache + sanity checks (Nordic F1, AU F7).
Change log (2026-08-15 b, after the China / Italy / Japan runs):
- one consistent rule for "map": false on rail/flight rows (docstring, WARNs, --help
  used to contradict each other — China F2, Italy F2).
- sun: moving days use the last stop; every unwritten day is a WARN + listed (Italy F5,
  China #9).
- links: "long legs kept unlinked (expected)" wording (Japan F11); --provider
  google|apple|amap + mainland-China warning.
Change log (2026-08-15 c, i18n):
- sun: --lang zh|en (default plan.lang > plan.meta.lang > zh) picks the dawn word
  ("天亮" / "dawn"); the renderers accept either spelling. zh output unchanged.
- geocode: head-token WARN on Nominatim hits (Japan F5).
Change log (2026-08-16, after the Mexico / Morocco / Turkey / Vietnam runs):
- links: name check is whole-word + folded for Latin, longest-first / substring-of-
  endpoint rule for CJK, generic shared tokens ignored (Mexico F2, Turkey F3);
  parked > 0 ends with a loud stderr WARN listing the parked rows, exit still 0
  (Morocco F6); the mainland-China WARN fires only for links actually printed /
  written into China, and the China test is a coarse polygon instead of a box that
  swallowed Hanoi (Turkey F8).
- sun: day["sun_stop"] (name or 0-based index) overrides the first/last-stop pick
  (Morocco F5); exit 1 whenever a day was skipped / failed, after writing the good
  days (Vietnam F6); a request failure is a skip (exit 1), not a "rejection" (3).
